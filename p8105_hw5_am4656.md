# Problem 1

In this problem, we create a dataframe containing data from participants
in the downloaded “data” folder. Each participant’s data is saved in a
separate file within this folder, which can be mapped in iterative
fashion using the read_csv function.

In general, patients in the experimental group have values that increase
over time. Patients in the control group have values that remain
relatively stable over time.

# Problem 2

This dataframe contains 12 columns which report location, assigned case
id (‘uid’), date of homicide, victim demographics, and case outcome
(`disposition`). There are 52179 rows and 50 distinct cities.
